# Tea-Cozy

This is a practice project from Codecademy, Tea Cozy. 

Description:
    In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

    We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

    This project focuses on essential web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and Flexbox

I made some changes such as opacity to 0.5 as 0.9 was too high, and some image sizing and position tweaks. Created in VSCode.
